# Sandbox Project

This project is created and maintained by [the-shoaib2](https://github.com/the-shoaib2) as a personal sandbox for testing and implementing new ideas, code snippets, and experiments. The main goal is to provide a safe environment for learning, prototyping, and exploring different technologies without affecting production code.

## How to Use

- Add any code you want to test in `src/main.ts` or create new files as needed.
- Run your code using your preferred method to see the results.
- Use this space to freely experiment and learn.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding new tests or improving existing implementations. Please follow the project's structure.
